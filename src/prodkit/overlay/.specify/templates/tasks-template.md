# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**KPI Instrumentation (Prod‑Kit)**: If the spec lists impacted KPIs, include tasks to ensure
those KPIs can be measured (instrumentation + dashboards) unless the plan explicitly records
a deferral with rationale and a revisit trigger.
