# prod-kit
Prod‑Kit is a product‑definition and delivery framework built on top of GitHub’s Spec‑Kit architecture. It preserves Spec‑Kit’s workflow, commands, and mental model, while layering in structured product thinking so teams can move from idea → product clarity → execution without losing context.
