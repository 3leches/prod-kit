# prod-kit
Prod‑Kit is a product‑definition and delivery framework built on top of GitHub’s Spec‑Kit architecture. It preserves Spec‑Kit’s workflow, commands, and mental model, while layering in structured product thinking so teams can move from idea → product clarity → execution without losing context.

## What this adds to Spec‑Kit

- **Spec‑Kit answers**: “What are we building?”
- **Prod‑Kit answers**: “Why this product, for whom, and how will we know it worked?”

## Core governance

The project’s non‑negotiable principles and required artifacts live in
`.specify/memory/constitution.md` (Prod‑Kit Constitution).
